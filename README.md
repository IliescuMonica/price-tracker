# Welcome to my **Day 47 Python Project!** 🚀  

This project is an **automated Price Tracker** that monitors the price of any product online and **notifies you via email** when it drops below a target price.  
It’s a hands-on exercise in **web scraping, data processing, and automation**.

## ⚡ How It Works

1. Set the **product URL** and your desired **price threshold**.  
2. Run the script – it fetches the latest **price and product name**.  
3. Receive an **email alert** if the price falls below your threshold.  
4. The script handles **text formatting automatically**, ensuring **clean, readable messages**.
